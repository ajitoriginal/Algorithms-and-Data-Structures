/*
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem
    Well defined inputs
    Each step should be clear
    Language independent

Why algorithms?
    Learn different techniques to efficiently solve problems
    One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms

Analysis of algorithm
    --To evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size
    --Time Complexity: Amount of time taken by algorithm to run as a function of input size
    --Space Complexity: Amount of memory taken by algorithm to run as a function of input size
    --There is no one solution that works best every single time. It is good to know multiple ways
      to solve a problem.
