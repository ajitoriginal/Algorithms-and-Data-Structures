An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

Characteristics
    Well defined inputs and outputs
    Each step should be clear
    Language independent

Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to
smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion is when a function calls itself. Every
recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.
